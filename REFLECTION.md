REFLECTION

What part of the code was most confusing and why?  
At first, understanding how `setInterval` repeats the animation logic on a timer was confusing because it doesn't block or pause the rest of the script. Once I realized that it's asynchronous and keeps going in the background, it made more sense.

How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
It shows that JavaScript can run tasks like DOM updates on a schedule without freezing the page. The animation keeps running in the background while the browser remains interactive.

What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I added a visual change where the background color turns green when the animation finishes. This makes the status more noticeable and adds a satisfying visual cue for the user.
